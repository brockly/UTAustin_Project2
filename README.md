# Machine Learning Project: Personal Loan Campaign

## Overview
This repository contains the **Personal Loan Campaign** machine learning project, completed as part of the Great Learning program in partnership with UT Austin. The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to identify potential customers for a personal loan product based on historical customer data.

## Context
AllLife Bank, a growing US bank, aims to convert more of its existing liability (depositor) customers into borrowers (asset customers). Previous marketing campaigns have shown a conversion rate of over 9%, motivating the bank's marketing department to use targeted strategies to further improve results. The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model to identify customers likely to accept personal loan offers.

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to help the marketing department at AllLife Bank identify customers with high potential for converting from liability customers (depositors) to asset customers (personal loan takers). The project includes:

- Identifying relevant factors influencing the likelihood of loan acceptance.
- Building and evaluating predictive models to increase the campaign's success rate.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following customer attributes:
